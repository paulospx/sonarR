# sonarR

This package adds support for the R language into SonarQube. It uses output from the `lintr` tool, which is processed by the plugin and uploaded into the SonarQube server. The plugin reports issues found by `lintr` (by processing its output) and has planned features such as syntax highlighting, code coverage, and code statistics.
