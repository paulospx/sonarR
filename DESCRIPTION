Description: This package adds support for the R language into SonarQube. 
  It uses output from the `lintr` tool, which is processed by the plugin and 
  uploaded into the SonarQube server. The plugin reports issues 
  found by `lintr` (by processing its output) and has planned features such
  as syntax highlighting, code coverage, and code statistics.
